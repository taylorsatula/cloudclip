stop emailing yourself 10,000 notes

sending yourself information from your phone to your computer shouldn't be a difficult task involving opening clipboard apps, opening email, copying from phone to an email addressed to yourself, opening your email on desktop, copying that, and pasting that into your original field
all those are clips are gonna linger in your email for the rest of eternity too... *cough* your credit card numbers *cough*

you should just be able to copy on the phone and securely paste on the desktop
KISS
